# Pothole_Detection
This project enables real-time pothole detection using a YOLO machine learning model, processing live camera feeds or uploaded videos to identify and display potholes on the road. It integrates a Streamlit web interface for easy interaction, allowing users to start camera detection or upload videos for analysis.
